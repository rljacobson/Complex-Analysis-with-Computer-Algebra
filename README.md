# Complex Analysis with Computer Algebra

This is a collection of Mathematica notebooks developed for use in an undergraduate complex variables course. If you do anything interesting with this or if you use it in your own classroom I would love to hear about it! However, there is no obligation to do so.

Best regards,

## `Complex Analysis with Mathematica.nb`
Think of this notebook as an extended cheat sheet. It gives a brief tour of Mathematica's built-in tools for working with complex numbers and functions. It also presents several different ways of using Mathematica to plot on the complex plane: curves, functions, regions of the plane, etc.

## `Iterative Maps.nb`
A brief example of how to use Mathematica to explore iterative maps. This notebook is rather sparse, so think of it more as a starting point than a complete tutorial.

## `Paper Globe Generator.nb`
Make paper globes out of spherical photos taken with, for example, a [Ricoh Theta spherical camera](https://theta360.com/). [Here's what they look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tswlTDB5M). A piece of letter size printer paper produces a globe about the size of a baseball. The globes in the linked video were printed on a large format printer and were 32 inches across.
